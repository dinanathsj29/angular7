01 Angular7 Introduction
=====================
1.1. What is Angular:
---------------------
- Angular is a JavaScript (TypeScript based) open-source front-end web application framework from Google
- A framework to build a client-side application
- Great for SPAs (Single Page Application)
- Angular Ver2/4/5/6/7 frameworks target Mobile and Desktop
- The very first version `Angular 1.0 (1.xx)` is known as `AngularJS`, versions beyond `2+ `are generally known as `Angular`

1.2. SPA (Single Page Application)
---------------------
A SPA (Single Page Application) is a website/web applications in which part of page reload asynchronously without loading/re-loading whole page/app. It contains the menu, navigations, buttons, and blocks on a single page, as-and-when a user clicks on any of them; it dynamically rewrites/loads the current page rather than loading entire new pages from a server and so it is reactive, fast and speedy. (Web apps that load a single HTML page and dynamically update that page as the user interacts with the app).
